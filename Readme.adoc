= Chatop.API

A collection of API endpoints in folder /chatop-api for project number 3 Openclassrooms using Spring Boot framework.

== API

* *Swagger documentation* is available at following endpoint (change host and port accordingly)
http://localhost:8081/api/swagger-ui/index.html

* Integration tests are available in */chatop-api/resources/Chatop-API.http* (requires latest version of IntelliJ IDEA)

* *Postman* json collection file for endpoints testing is available in */chatop-api/resources/rental.postman_collection.json*

== Run the API project with docker
For demo purposes, I will be using *Docker*.

The configuration file *docker-compose.yml* can be found at the root of the chatop-api project. It consists in 3 different services:

* One MySQL instance (an empty database named *db_chatop* that will be created when mysql image will be mounted.)
* One Adminer instance
* The spring boot API project

I am using *docker secrets* to manage any sensitive data such as database password which the container needs at runtime but you don't want to store in the image or in source control.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/

* Run docker in swarm mode by using
+
[source]
$ docker swarm init
--

* Create a random password for the mySQL database root user  (mysql-root-pass is the secret name defined in docker-compose.yml)
+
[source]
$ openssl rand -base64 12 | docker secret create mysql-root-pass -
--

* Create a random secret for jwt token creation (jwt-secret-pass is the secret name defined in docker-compose.yml)
+
[source]
$ node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))" | docker secret create jwt-secret-pass -
--

Deployment time!

* Startup project Jar file must be created using maven package (mvn package)

* Build the spring boot project Docker image
+
[source]

$ docker build --no-cache -t springboot-chatop-api:latest .
--

* Deploy all services with Docker stack
+
[source]
--
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml myStack
--
For development purposes, to check for the generated database root password, we need following command to view its actual value.

* We need to get a list of processes running so that we can extract the name of the actual running instance of mySQL
+
[source]
--
$ docker ps
--

You should get something like this:

image::/resources/dockerPS.jpeg[]

* Finally we can extract the password via the following command (replace with the name of the running instance of mySQL as shown as here-above picture)
+
[source]
--
$ docker exec -it $(docker ps -f name=instanceName -q) cat /run/secrets/mysql-root-pass
--

The actual password value will be displayed as here-below

image::/resources/extractDockerDbRootPwd.jpeg[]

You can now connect to the MySQL instance by connecting to the web interface of adminer running on http://127.0.0.1:8080  as root user (that is bad practice in production!).

== Angular project

The frontend project in folder /Angular is used to test dockerized, or in debug mode... API endpoints.

Host and port may have to be amended accordingly with your API configuration in frontend source code.
